Using Uber Pick Up Data To Improve NYC's MTA
--------------------------------------------

### Introduction

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is New York City's public transportation system. This service allows the residents of New York City, those who live in the city's vicinity, and other visitors to have a viable mode of transportation that is inexpensive and convenient. While many use it it as their main mode of transportation, there are other private services such as taxis and ride share companies that have created additional options to New York City's commuters.

### Research and Application

In this project I want to use Uber's location data for pick ups from April to September 2014(found [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response)) to find out which areas of New York City there is more Uber service usage. This data includes the latitude and longitude coordinates of the pick up location, as well as the date and time of when it occurred. What this can help the MTA and the City Government do is identify where are the potential areas where the public transportation system is either so poor or inconvenient that paying for an Uber might be a better option for commuters. Furthermore, these findings can help these institutions identify areas where they need to increase, extend, or improve service.

I will also take weather data and holiday data to not only to make sure that my findings take certain factors such as bad weather and holidays into account, but also potentially shine light into service problems when these conditions are in effect.

### Deliverables

I will deliver my findings with the code that shows used to reach the results of the research, a report that will include all of the pertinent information from the project as well as recommendations for the MTA, and finally a slide deck presentation that will illustrate the entire research project.
